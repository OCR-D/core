    This makes it possible to use provided password/keyfile for connecting with
    python-docker-sdk, which otherwise only allows to use ~/.ssh/config for
    login

    XXX: inspired by https://github.com/docker/docker-py/issues/2416 . Should be replaced when
    docker-sdk provides its own way to make it possible to use custom SSH Credentials. Possible
    Problems: APIClient must be given the API-version because it cannot connect prior to read it. I
    could imagine this could cause Problems. This is not a rushed implementation and was the only
    workaround I could find that allows password/keyfile to be used (by default only keyfile from
    ~/.ssh/config can be used to authenticate via ssh)

    XXX 2: Reasons to extend DockerClient: The code-changes regarding the connection should be in
    one place, so I decided to create `CustomSshHttpAdapter` as an inner class. The super
    constructor *must not* be called to make this workaround work. Otherwise, the APIClient
    constructor would be invoked without `version` and that would cause a connection-attempt before
    this workaround can be applied.
